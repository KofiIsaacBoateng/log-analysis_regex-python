# LOG ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

### REPO DESCRIPTION
  * This script reads data from a log file and categorizes it's findings into the \
    number of occurrences of each error message logged.

  * It also generates data about which user is responsible for each log message \
    and displays the number of ERROR and INFO logs each user generated over the \
    the period

  * You can find the log file from 'syslog.log' in the repo. Two csv files are \
    generated as a result following the descriptions above. The error_report.csv\
    and user_report.csv.

  * Finally, these csv files are converted into html tables in a .html file for\
    each csv file for an even better visualization
